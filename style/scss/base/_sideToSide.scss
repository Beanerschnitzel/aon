/*  SIDE TO SIDE
========================================================================== */

/*
* Pretty basic. A common pattern where two elements are stacked on mobile and then
* left and right justified horizontally on larger screens.
* Usage:
  <div class="sideToSideMed">
    <h4>First element</h4>
    <a class="btn">Second element</a>
  </div>

* We are defining the non-mobile styles of sideToSide here as an include so we don't have to rewrite it for each
* of the breakpoints below
